Description: Quantify disease transmission within and between population groups 
   using R. The bumblebee package uses counts of observed directed transmission 
   pairs, identified phylogenetically from deep-sequence data or from 
   epidemiological contacts, to quantify transmission flows within and between 
   population groups accounting for sampling heterogeneity. Population groups
   might include: geographical areas (e.g. communities, regions), demographic 
   groups (e.g. age, gender) or arms of a randomized clinical trial. See the
   bumblebee website for statistical theory, documentation and examples
